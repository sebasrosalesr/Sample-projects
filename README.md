Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase a diverse range of sample projects that demonstrate my expertise in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. With over 13 years of experience in data-driven solutions and AI engineering, I have a deep understanding of the intersection between business and technology.

Featured Projects

1. Live Face Detector Model

A real-time face detection model leveraging OpenCV and deep learning techniques. This project implements a model that accurately detects faces in live video streams, ideal for applications such as security systems and interactive user experiences.

2. BTC Prediction Time Series

A time series forecasting model designed to predict the future price of Bitcoin using machine learning algorithms. The project incorporates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to provide robust predictions in the cryptocurrency market.

3. Sentiment Classifier for Twitter

This project utilizes a machine learning model to classify tweets based on their sentiment (positive or negative). It highlights text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, and the use of synthetic data for training.

4. CNN-Based Image Classification

A convolutional neural network model built to classify images from a custom dataset. The project demonstrates proficiency in data augmentation, model optimization, and validation.

5. Small Business Chatbot

An AI chatbot designed for small businesses, integrated with a Flask app. This bot is capable of handling basic customer inquiries and provides an example of chatbot implementation using Python, NLP, and Twilio for WhatsApp integration.
